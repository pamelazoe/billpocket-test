# List insertion

 Create a visual model for explaining list insertion. The model must consist of three elements:
 - List display section: The section on the page where the list will be displayed.
 - Text field: A field to provide input for inserting a new element into the list.
 - Button (named "Insert"): Clicking this button inserts a new element at the end
 of the existing list using the value provided in the text field.

 Other requirements:
 - No element should be inserted if the text field is empty when the user clicks the button.
 - Every third element in the list must be displayed in red and the remaining elements in black.
